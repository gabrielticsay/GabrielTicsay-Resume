        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Gabriel Ticsay, a first year undergraduate student attending the University of California, Riverside. My major is currently Pre-Business, planning to major in Business Analytics by my third year. A little about me is that I enjoy playing games, spending time with my friends, and even competing in sports/working out.
	Originally, I was born in the Philippines, January 31, 2003 in a city called Baliuag. It wasnâ€™t so soon that I moved to America in hopes to proceed with my life here. I was very unsure of what I wanted to do as I grew up. I had big hopes and aspirations when I was a small child, wanting to be involved with the sports industry. I always wanted to be a basketball player in the NBA, but it was only soon to realize that I wouldnâ€™t have made it. But as time came and college grew nearer, I knew that the business path was one that intrigued me highly. 

<br><br>

        A little background on why I decided business was a good idea for me, was because I always enjoyed the idea of completing tasks at home. Since I was younger, I was always very involved with tech. I began using my first computer when I was only about 6 years old, and from then have always loved the idea of technology. Thinking about the scenery of an office job may have scared me due to the ergonomics, but I knew that it fit my style of work due to my past experience.
When it comes to influences and my decision, it was very simple. My parents have always been hard-working throughout their career, and it is due to them I have gotten this far. They have influenced me to apply that same mindset throughout my life, and have supported me and my decisions throughout all my years. As for business specific influences, that came from my aunt. My aunt attended the University of California, Berkeley, the number one rated public school in America. Knowing she attended this high end school with a focus on accounting really helped me forge my decision. She also helped me throughout my whole process, and is looking for me to be successful when time comes.

<br><br>

        In general, I have always had a dream of something similar within a business job, but it was only now that I could reinforce that dream. As time comes, I only want to be successful in my life, in hopes to help others be successful as well. I strive for the challenges and experiences which a job like this can bring me, and I hope to prove myself with my skills. I believe that throughout my time, I can be, and will improve more to become a valuable asset to a company.
Overall, I hope to seek and involve myself within a company, so I can achieve my goal of creating a community that succeeds together. I love the environment, and only hope to allocate my personal skills within that field.
